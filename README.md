# Yield-Curve-Prediction
The aim of this project is to explain and extend the Case Study 2 ‘Yield Curve Prediction’ of Chapter 7 of Machine Learning and Data Science Blueprints for
finance by Tatsat. It is a classic model for multiple asset predictions. This case study uses principal component analysis (PCA) to generate the typical movements of a yield curve. It demonstrated
the efficiency of dimensionality reduction and PCA in reducing the number of dimensions and
adding intuitive features to the original model. It also helps remove redundant features, if any.
Dimensionality Reduction helps in data compressing and reducing the storage space required

Moreover, it fastens the time required for performing the same computations.
However, we also notice that we could improve this model by adding a few steps to it.
Example steps can be Model tuning, Grid searching for the optimal parameters, Finalizing the
Model, and Backtesting. Furthermore, we could also use White Reality Check for evaluating the
results.

Besides adding steps to the original model, we could also consider applying more models
to reconstruct data, evaluate and compare the results. Some popular unsupervised learning
algorithms we consider using are K-means clustering, KNN (k-nearest neighbors), Hierarchical
clustering, Anomaly detection, Neural Networks, Independent Component Analysis, Apriori
algorithm and Singular value decomposition(SVD).
